revisit workflow: runs a bunch of programs
some come installed on UNIX, some don't
you figure out which is why through experience
lots of ways to install software, many of them system specific (Linux - apt; yum; Mac)
most require ownership or sysadmin privileges on computer
most also require that the software be compatbile with other software and OS / not interfere with other software

conda is a program that supports isolated environments, non-admin approval, text install files with version pinning
integrated with snakemake so that snakemake manages installations, too

with conda you can -
* install and update software yourself (incuding conda)
* on Mac and Linux environments, and sometimes Windows
* record what you've installed and communicate it to other people
* have multiple different installations of incompatible software (python2 vs python3)
* provide the community with conda environments

this lets you also -
* expeiriment with new vesrions without messing up old installations
* work with colalborators who like software that you don't necessarily use a lot
* "pin" your versions so that you're always using the same version of the software (until you decide you want to change)

diagram of how conda works

what are we going to do on wed?
* install some software using conda (fastqc and trimmomatic, specifically)
* try running it and looking at the output
* show you how to find different versions
* show you how to create conda environment files and use them
